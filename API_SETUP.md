# API Setup Guide

## ⚠️ Note

**API functionality has been temporarily removed from this project.** This file is kept for future reference when API features are re-implemented.

## Future Implementation

When API features are re-implemented, they will provide:
- Centralized data access for portfolio content
- RESTful endpoints for gallery images, videos, projects, etc.
- Read-only access with proper security measures

## Current Data Loading

Currently, the website loads data directly from JSON files:
- `assets/images/gallery-data.json` - Gallery images
- `assets/videos/videos-data.json` - Gallery videos

See the main [README.md](./README.md) for current content management instructions.
