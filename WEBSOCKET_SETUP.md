# WebSocket Setup Guide

## ⚠️ Note

**WebSocket functionality has been temporarily removed from this project.** This file is kept for future reference when WebSocket features are re-implemented.

## Future Implementation

When WebSocket features are re-implemented, they will provide:
- Real-time visitor count tracking
- Live updates and notifications
- Activity monitoring
- Real-time gallery updates

## Current State

The website currently works without WebSocket functionality. All features are available through standard HTTP requests and local JSON file loading.

See the main [README.md](./README.md) for current setup instructions.
